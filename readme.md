# 💻 CS40 Homework Assignment – Universal Machine Emulator (C)
This repository contains my solution to Homework 6 for CS40 (Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming), a course I completed at Tufts University. The assignment focused on building a Universal Machine (UM) emulator in C that supports segmented memory, register-based instructions, and efficient execution of UM programs.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Emulating a register-based Universal Machine (UM)
- Implementing segmented memory with mapping and unmapping
- Bit-packing and instruction decoding
- Switch-case dispatch for opcode execution
- Efficient memory management with UArrays and sequences
- Assertion-based error handling for invalid operations
- Performance optimization techniques for large instruction counts

## ▶️ Running the UM Emulator

### 🛠 Requirements

- GCC or compatible C compiler
- Tufts CS40 support files: uarray.h, seq.h, bitpack.h, atom.h, table.h, etc.
- Standard POSIX environment

### 🔧 Build & Run
```bash
make
./um hello.um
```

Replace hello.um with any valid UM program file. The emulator reads the program, initializes segmented memory, and executes instructions until halt or program end.

## 🏗 Architecture Overview
`um.c`

- Reads a .um file, converts its contents into 32-bit words using UArray_T
- Passes the program array to run() to start emulation

`um_driver.c`

- Implements the main UM runtime loop and instruction execution
- Maintains program counter, registers array, and segmented memory instance
- Uses a switch statement for fast opcode dispatch
- Implements each opcode command (conditional_move, segmented_load, halt, etc.) as an inline function
- Uses assertions to catch invalid register indices and illegal operations

`segments.c`

- Implements segmented memory as a table mapping segment IDs to UArray_T sequences of 32-bit words
- Tracks unmapped segment IDs for reuse, avoiding ID exhaustion
- Supports mapping new zero-initialized segments and unmapping existing ones
- Provides word-level load and store functions with bounds checking
- Manages segment 0 specially as the currently running program segment
- Includes cleanup functions to free individual and all segments from memory safely

## 🧪 Test Programs Included (umtests/)

| Test Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `halt.um` |	Tests halt instruction stops execution |
| `load_val.um` | Tests loading immediate values into registers |
| `output.um`	| Tests character output via the output opcode |
| `add.um` | Tests basic addition instruction |
| `map1.um` | Tests segment mapping |
| `input.um` | Tests input instruction and EOF handling |
| `operations.um`| Tests combined instruction set with various ops |

## ⏳ Performance

- Initial design using sequences for segments was too slow on large inputs
- Refactored to use UArray_T for segments to reduce overhead
- Optimized mapping/unmapping logic and segment copying using UArray_copy
- Switching from sequences to arrays for registers improved speed
- Using switch-case instead of function pointers sped up opcode dispatch
- Example: Emulator ran 50 million instructions in approximately 27 hours and 47 minutes on a midmark.um test

## 🕒 Time Spent

- Analyzing the assignment: ~3 hours
- Preparing design and architecture: ~10 hours
- Implementation and debugging: ~20 hours

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Implementing a complex virtual machine architecture in C
- Designing and managing segmented memory with dynamic allocation and reuse
- Low-level bit manipulation for instruction decoding
- Balancing code correctness with runtime performance optimizations
- Using assertions effectively to detect and prevent invalid operations
- Modular program design separating memory management and execution logic
